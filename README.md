Ad Assist Project
I created a little python program to help speed up the process of creating ad campaigns on amazon.

The buttons on the left copy specified product SKUs, and the left column alows me to enter a list name from a data base  
with correspoding copy buttons that generate out an organized campaign titles

there also is a switch that can change one aspect of the the title with coresponding check boxes to indicate if it should be 
switched on of off next to the list copy buttons.
